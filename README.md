# react-native-input-outline

I built this library because of all the performance issues I noticed in other TextInput libraries I noticed.
This library is extremely performant thanks to Reanimated v2, and I'm very proud of it.

Performant React Native Text Inputs built with Reanimated 2.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-reanimated@2.0.0-rc.0 react-native-input-outline
```

Reanimated v2 is required for this library to work.

## Usage

```js
import { InputOutline } from 'react-native-input-outline';

<InputOutline />;
```

All vanilla [ReactNative TextInput Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#props) are supported as well as others configured from this library shown below.

### Props

All props will be shown here.
